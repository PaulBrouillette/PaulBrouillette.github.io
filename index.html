The pumpkin head guy goes, 'Well, there was this genie guy and he granted me three wishes but I really screwed up.' So the regular guy asks, 'Well, what happened?' Pumpkin head goes, 'Well for my first wish, I asked for like a hundred million dollars and I got that, and for my second wish I wished for a beautiful woman to be my wife and I got that too. But for the third wish I really blew it.' The regular guy says, 'Well, what happened? Did you try to cheat the genie, did he punish you for asking for infinite wishes?' The pumpkin head guy goes, 'No, I wished for a giant pumpkin head.'", "So there was this kid playing outside with some blocks and other child toys. He was having so much fun, as much fun as a kid can have playing with blocks. I mean he was having an absolute blast playing with those blocks and using his imagination. His mom calls him in to help with dinner and the kid asks, 'What's for dinner mom?' His mom says 'Chicken with thyme.' The kid is shocked to hear this. He is perturbed. Dare I say, distraught. So the kid sets the table and he goes back to playing, but he just can't have any more fun. He tries his hardest, playing with his blocks and all, but he just can't have any fun anymore. His dad comes home after work and notices that the kid has a frown and a downtrodden expression. His dad asks, 'Son, why the long face?' The kid goes, 'Dad, mom's making chicken for dinner, but she's putting THYME on it! And I don't know why, but thyme always makes me gloomy.' The dad says, 'Well son, fun flies when you're having thyme.'", "So there was this family with one hundred kids. They were named after the order in which they were born, the first being named ‘One’, the second ‘Two’ and so on. They built a huge church on their land all to themselves so they could all fit into it during their day of worship. However, one day during service the church caught fire and everyone sans one person survived, one of the kids who was named ‘Ninety’. Life went on, and she eventually had children of her own. Her children found a stray dog and wanted to keep it, but Ninety was allergic to dogs, so the kids secretly kept it anyway but named the dog ‘This’ so they could talk about the dog in secret like a codename. One day their dog ran away, only ninety's kids will remember This."];

                        I'm a graduate from Siena College with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
                        I'm from a really tiny town called Waterville in Central New York and I'm the middle child of three.<br><br>
                        Currently, I'm looking for a full-time position as a Software Engineer. I'm interested in working on
                        anything related to code, as I absolutely love to figure out crafty solutions to problems through code.<br><br>

                        If history stands to tell us what humans were like in the past, then we can conclude that humans were pretty weird.
                        Back in the Middle Ages, especially when the Black Death hit Europe, monks drew pictures like the one to the left
                        because rabbits were responsible for eating crops that were meant to feed people. While rabbits probably didn't 
                        mug people in the Middle Ages, I think odd imagery like this is though provoking because it shows that people even
                        hundreds of years ago had a sense of humor, contrary to the traditional view of the Middle Ages as a dark and boring time.

                        Any good programmer knows that sitting behind a desk for hours at a time isn't the greatest thing for the body. And 
                        even though hiking won't cure the inevitable carpal tunnel, I find that it trains both the body and the mind. You never
                        know what you mind find on a hike, like a nice little waterfall, and the fresh air can really rejuvenate your mind. The best
                        work that I put out is usually after a nice hike or even a walk around the block.

                        Second to Benadryl, I consider laughter to be the best medicine. However, the jokes I tell have been desribed as "odd",
                        "strange", and "anti-humor". If you don't think they're that funny, that's ok. I think they're funny. Judge for yourself with the following joke:<br>

                            For the Siena College comp sci capstone course Software Engineering I & II, teams are assigned to start a new
                            or continue an old project. My team continued work on a project that was started by a previous team, a touring app
                            for the Siena College campus. The app uses augmented reality to display information about rooms and is made to be 
                            a self guided tour for prospective students. I was heavily involved in the code for the app, and our team made 
                            huge strides to the contribution of the app, completing the entire third floor of the school's science building. I will be coming back
                            to the project as a liaison for the next team to help their endeavours. Check out the code <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/SienaCollegeSoftwareEngineering/SoS_F19S20_F20S21_F21S22_F22S23">here</a>

                            Anachromania is a game that I started to make during the Summer of 2022, after my internship ended. I have always
                            wanted to make a game, and decided that I learned enough about programming to make one. I used GameMaker: Studio
                            to make the game, and I learned the language mainly through self teaching. It's not nearly as popular as Unity or
                            Unreal Engine, so there's less tutorials but more oppurtunity to be creative and crafy. Check out the code <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/PaulBrouillette/Anachromania-Code">here</a>
